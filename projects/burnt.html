projTitle: BURNT
projBio: "BURNT is on a mission to advance societyâ€™s financial and creative freedom by redefining the means of Art ownership. BURNT was born out of the vision of its founder when he purchased a BANKSY piece of art for $90,000 that he then set on fire and burnt live on camera. He recorded the stunt and made the video an NFT collectible that went on to sell for $380,000.
<br><br>
BURNT needed a solid and trusting strategic foundation for a technology that is not yet entirely understood by the mainstream.
<br><br>
We built a Brand Identity rooted in old black letter as a symbol of trust that pays homage to the visionary pioneer spirit of the Brand. The word mark is based on the typeface Respira Black by Sharp Type. We then created a custom flame icon called 'BLAZE' that seamlessly integrates within the letterforms and will allow the brand to scale their line of products while maintaining brand integrity.
<br><br>
As fire naturally burns and inevitably makes way for the new, the BURNT brand identity honors the past while clearing the way for a fairer and more distributed future where creators can truly own a share of their artwork.

projTitle: "TOT: Designers on Design"
projBio: "The inaugural issue of TYPE OF TODAY is titled “DESIGNERS ON DESIGN,” which compiles various writings and discourses on what contemporary design “should” look like. The publication features my writing, along with writings from other designers such as Massimo Vignelli, Ed Benguiat, Beatrice Walde, and Paul Rand. While I agree with some of their perspectives and disagree with others, I aimed to present both sides of the highly contested subject matter to reflect the real-life discussions on this topic.
<br><br>The paper's bold and disruptive visual language and design serve as a satirical critique and/or commentary. I developed a visual language grounded in dark pixel forms, creating disruption. I also incorporated custom typesetting and lettering that combined multiple typefaces, created pixel illustrations, manipulated negative space, and intentionally disregarded conventional design principles. Through my design, I wanted to convey my perspective as a young designer on the subject, which emphasizes the need to embrace the unconventional and the weird in contemporary design."

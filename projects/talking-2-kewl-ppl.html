projTitle: Talking 2 Kewl PPL
projBio: 'A unique take on a prompt asking "What is home to you". For me, home is the comfortability I get around friends. This zine is meant to express that feeling through the unique ways I communicate with them. As a result is a comical and graphic booklet filled with tips and tricks in "talking to kewl people" just like me.

Accompanied is a sticker sheet meant to serve as a fly-in for the zine'

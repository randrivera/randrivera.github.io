projTitle: Trashbin
projBio: "Trashbin is a mixed-case typeface inspired by a graffiti sign that was sighted upon during a walk on Canal St. The initial grafitti only consisted of the letters: C, A, N, + L, in which the rest of the letterforms were inspired from. 
    <br><br>
    The typespecimen brings the typeface back to it's original sighting, graffitied on a wall, surrounded by custom SA and design inspired stickers. You can purchase the typeface here and all proceeds will go back to the Chinatown Partnership 
    <br><br>
    This short type exploration was made during my time at Sunday Afternoon and is part of the project <a href='/projects/canal-issue-2.html' style='color:var(--my-variable)'>CANAL Issue 2</a>."

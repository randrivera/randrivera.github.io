projTitle: Columbia Records Refresh
projBio: "The proposed Columbia Records Refresh concept draws inspiration from the iconic vinyl logo used by the label in the 1970s. This refreshed identity takes advantage of the current resurgence of disco and house in contemporary music. The intention is to modernize the identity while retaining its historic roots, the era in which disco and house music was popularized. To achieve this, the brand identity is bold, colorful, and vibrant.
<br><br>
The logo has been redrawn, updating it for more modern uses, and is complemented with a custom typeface that can be used throughout the system. The large, blocky letterforms allow for fun, playful compositions through stacking. Additionally, a logo video has been created to showcase the logo in motion, providing a dynamic and engaging visual to promote the new look.
<br><br>
To further promote the new brand identity, a series of static and kinetic advertising posters have been developed. These posters are bold and colorful, creating a striking visual impact that captures the essence of the brand. They incorporate the new logo, halftone image treatment, and vibrant colors and showcase signed artists to create a cohesive and visually striking campaign. The rebranding effort extends to Columbia Records' social media platforms, where curated posts and stories have been created based on the current Columbia Records instagram feed."

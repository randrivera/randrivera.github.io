projTitle: Can I Make Robot Rand?
projBio: "I explore how relentless curiosity catalyzes transformative shifts in the design process, moving from a focus on solutions to exploring the depths of the “whys.” The guiding question, “Can I Make Robot Rand?” serves not as a definitive goal but as a springboard for generating new ideas and avenues for exploration with AI. The emphasis is not on creating a completed Robot Rand but on using the concept as a means to delve into uncharted territories of AI’s potential. AI becomes an endless playground, and by engaging with AI in this manner, I transform the design journey into a space encouraging experimentation and continuous discovery.
<br><br>

I documented my journey using a receipt-style process book, blending AI's endless creativity with the simplicity of receipt printing. This juxtaposition highlights my belief in AI as a collaborator, not just a tool. Instead of fearing AI's dominance, I focus on input—words, questions, and curiosity.  The long, continuous strip of paper becomes a tangible timeline of my intellectual journey, emphasizing the process over the product.

projTitle: CANAL Issue 2
projBio: "Canal Street has been home to the Sunday Afternoon office for a few years now. It's been a tremendous source of energy and inspiration. We've channeled it all in an ongoing passion project of a newsprint that pays homage to this wonderful New York oddity that is Canal Street. We've obviously called it 'CANAL'.
<br><br>
This 2nd issue is bigger and better with more spreads and mind-blowing AR filters that bring this iconic NYC neighborhood to life in a whole new way. This is a true convergence of print, design, technology, and even film.
<br><br>
I've had the pleasure to create some spreads during my time in SA in which I explored various mediums like experimental collage, riso animation, and even got the chance to create my own Canal-inspired typeface (see <a href='/projects/trashbin.html' style='color:var(--my-variable)'>Trashbin</a> case study for more info)!

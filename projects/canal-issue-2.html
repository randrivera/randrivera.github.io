projTitle: CANAL Issue 2
projBio: "Canal Street has been home to the Sunday Afternon office for a few years now. It's been a tremendous source of energy and inspiration. We've channeled it all in an ongoing passion project of a newsprint that pays homage to this wonderful New York oddity that is Canal Street. We've obviously called it 'CANAL'.
<br><br>
This 2nd issue is bigger and better with more spreads and mind-blowing AR filters that bring this iconic NYC neighborhood to life in a whole new way. This is a true convergence of print, design, technology, and even film."

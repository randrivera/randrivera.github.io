projTitle: Roadsign Americana
projBio: 'Taking inspiration from the quirkiness and oddities in old business/shop roadsigns found across America and creating a new typeface that brings back the spirit in logos and brands stuck in a "Helvetica, sans-serif world"
<br><br>
This coded site is two part: the first part makes the user "Americana-ify" these logos using the slider, only allowing to move forward if the slider is at peak "Americana"; the second part is a text generator that utilizes the typefaces allowing the user to make their own logos
<br><br>

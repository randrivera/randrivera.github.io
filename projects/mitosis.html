projTitle: Mitosis
projBio: 'A modular typeface inspired by the process of cellular reproduction of the name same. Using a 3x3 grid of "cells", the letterforms were created using the modulars derived from merging any two cells from the grid.
<br><br>
The resulting typeface is a monospace great for display. With further exploration, this typeface can explore the possibilities of variable fonts by playing with how "stretched" the middle section is. At the very least, alternative characters for the letterforms are expected to come.'

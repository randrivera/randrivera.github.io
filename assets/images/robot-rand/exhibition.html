    <div style="width:60%; align-self: center; text-align: center;">For the open studio exhibition, I created a site in which people can interact with a chatbot that I gave context to respond in my certain tone and vernacular, in essence a <i>Robot Rand</i><br><br>
        They could talk to Robot Rand about anything they wanted, then when they were done they could print their conversation which was automatically formatted and sent to the receipt printer when submitted.
        <br><br>The goal was to encourage people to do the same process I did talking to an LLM and see where their inquiry takes them.</div>

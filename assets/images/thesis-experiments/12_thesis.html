    <div class="bold">What <i>does</i> the Mona Lisa look like?</div>
    <div> A picture is worth a thousand words... but what do those 1000 words need to say? How interconnected is text and imagery, and how can AI bridge the two?
        <br><br>
        After seeing a TikTok about how a blind woman visited the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa and was given a tactile sheet to help visualize the painting, I was curious what would happen if you only could use words as an aid. So I asked people to fill out a form which asked to describe the Mona Lisa in as much detail as possible without saying “Mona Lisa” or “Da Vinci”. Then I inputted all the responses into PlaygroundAI (a text-to-image generator) and generated three images for each. I then collected the images into a square booklet bounded on the corner by a screw. I wanted the reader to be able to overlay original Mona Lisa (printed on clear acetate) over the outputted Mona Lisas. At the end of tje book, I provided an index of all the responses for the reader to see and compare the verbiages.

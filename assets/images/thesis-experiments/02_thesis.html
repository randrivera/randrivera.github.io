    <div>I collected 86 AI-generated faces using the site <a target='_blank' href='https://thispersondoesnotexist.com' style='color:var(--my-variable)'>thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>. I then separated each face into its eyes, nose, and mouth into a three part spiral-books. This allowed you to play with each face part in order to generate new faces from faces that themselves were generated. I documented just a few of the face-combinations possible, but in theory there are 71,570 faces that can be made.
